# Examples
In this directory, you will find a few example scripts that I've created to test or experiment some functionality that I thought would be worth sharing.

* [`random_images`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/examples/programs/random_images.ipynb?flush_cache=True)<br>
Display a set of random images in the hub

* [`push_my_color`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/examples/programs/push_my_color.ipynb?flush_cache=True)<br>
Small game where the hub "thinks" of a random color and the player has to guess it by using the hub's buttons.

* [`mshub_vs_hub`](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/examples/programs/mshub_vs_hub.ipynb?flush_cache=True)<br>
A comparison between the functionality offered by `MSHub` and `hub`. I will be constantly updating this one as I learn more about them.

* More examples to come...
