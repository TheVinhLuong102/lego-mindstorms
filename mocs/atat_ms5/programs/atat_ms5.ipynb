Instead, I found this very cool [computational model of an AT-AT walking](https://sketchfab.com/models/c5a4ab826eda4458aa748e252631735e/). It is fantastic. Try playing with it and move the camera around.\n",

    "I found that the most intuitive way is to do this graphically step by step. Let's start defining our plot for one leg only (let's say leg `F`). We will be looking at the motors' position $motor\\_position$ (in degrees) as a function of time $t$ (in miliseconds). Moreover, we will define the period $T$ as the time it takes for a leg to do a complete cycle. Therefore:\n",

We already defined that at any moment, only one leg of the AT-AT is in the air. Since we are talking about 4 legs, that means that each leg spends $T/4$ off the ground. Moreover, we can see from the GIF that during this time, the leg goes from 0 to 180$^{\\circ}$. In consequence, it takes the leg the rest of the period ($3T/4$) to go from 180 to 360$^{\\circ}$.
