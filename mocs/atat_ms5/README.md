# ATAT MS5

<p>

I wanted to create a cool MOC to celebrate this year's May the 4th. This is what I came up with: an All Terrain Armored Transport using the MINDSTORMS 51515 set, or **AT-AT MS5** in short. There was a motorized AT-AT build in the Dark Side Developer Kit (9754). However, since it was released on 2000, I feel it was in urgent need of an update.

You can read more about this build and, most importantly, find the building instructions [here](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/atat-ms5/).

I've included the program in two different ways:
* You can find the [`.py` script here](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/mocs/atat_ms5/programs/atat_ms5.py). This is the code that you would need to get the AAT MS5 up and running. To do so, just copy and paste the content of the script in a new MINDSTORMS Python project and you will be good to go.
* If you want to read and understand what the program is doing, I recommend you take a look at the corresponding [Jupyter notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/mocs/atat_ms5/programs/atat_ms5.ipynb?flush_cache=True). I especially encourage you to go through the notebook if you are interested in the technical details of the motor control.

The best part: seeing the whole thing in action!

I love how the looked turned out. Unfortunately, as you can see, the AT-AT MS5 doesn't perform very well on smooth surfaces ðŸ˜…. I guess a redesign of the legs could have helped. However, I needed the pieces for another MOC, so I decided to leave it as it is. I have to admit that in the end it turned out quite funny.
