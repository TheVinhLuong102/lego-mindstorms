# AAT MS5
Armored Assault Tank using the MINDSTORMS 51515 set, or **AAT MS5** in short. It is inspired by the [Battle Droid on STAP](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/battle-droid-stap/) of the Droid Developer Kit and the [AAT](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/aat/) of the Dark Side Developer Kit.

You can read more about this build and, most importantly, find the building instructions [here](https://arturomoncadatorres.com/aat-ms5/).

I've included the program in two different ways:
* You can find the [`.py` script here](https://github.com/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/original/aat_ms5/programs/aat_ms5.py). This is the code that you would need to get the AAT MS5 up and running. To do so, just copy and paste the content of the script in a new MINDSTORMS Python project and you will be good to go.
* If you want to read and understand what the program is doing, I recommend you take a look at the corresponding [Jupyter notebook here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/arturomoncadatorres/lego-mindstorms/blob/main/original/aat_ms5/programs/aat_ms5.ipynb?flush_cache=True).
